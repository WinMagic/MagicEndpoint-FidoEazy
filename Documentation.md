# MagicEndpoint FidoEazy Usage Documentation

This document provides step-by-step instructions on how to use MagicEndpoint FidoEazy for secure SSH access on Windows.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

* **Windows OS:** MagicEndpoint FidoEazy is currently compatible with Windows operating systems only.
* **TPM 2.0:** A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 2.0 is required for secure key storage and device binding.  Most modern systems have this, but you may need to enable it in your BIOS settings.
* **OpenSSH v8.5+:** OpenSSH is required for SSH connectivity.  You can download the latest version from the official Microsoft GitHub page: [OpenSSH-Win64-v9.8.1.0.msi](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/releases/download/v9.8.1.0p1-Preview/OpenSSH-Win64-v9.8.1.0.msi).  For more information on installing OpenSSH, please refer to the Microsoft documentation: [Install-Win32-OpenSSH](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/wiki/Install-Win32-OpenSSH).
